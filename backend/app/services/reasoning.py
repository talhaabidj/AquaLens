"""Gemini-powered narrative for risk assessments.

The deterministic risk score from :mod:`app.services.risk_model` is the
source of truth for the numeric level and urgency. This module produces
the human-readable text that wraps the numbers: a recommendation,
reasoning trace, and a limitations note.

Why a separate module:
- Keeps LLM I/O out of the deterministic scoring path so the score is
  always reproducible and testable without API access.
- Forces a structured-output contract (``ReasoningBundle``) the rest of
  the application can rely on.
- Provides a single seam where tests can mock or set
  ``AQUALENS_FAKE_GEMINI=1`` for offline CI runs.
